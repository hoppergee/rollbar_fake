# Ratchetio

Ruby gem for Ratchet.io, for reporting exceptions in Rails 3 to Ratchet.io. Requires a Ratchet.io account (you can sign up for free).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ratchetio'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ratchetio

Then, creat a file config/nitializers/ratchetio.rb containing the following:

```ruby
require 'ratchetio/rails'
Ratchetio.configure do |config|
    conifg.access_token = 'YOUR_RATCHETIO_PROJECT_ACCESS_TOKEN'
end
```
Or, run the following command from your rails  root:

```ruby
$ rails generate ratchetio YOUR_RATCETIO_PROJECT_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

That will create the file `config/initializers/ratchetio.rb`, which holds the configuration values (currently just your access token) and is all you need to use Ratchet.io with Rails.

To confirm that it worked, run:

```ruby
$ rake ratchetio:test
```

This will raise an exception within a test request; if it works, you'll see a stacktrace in the console, and the exception will appear in the Ratchet.io dashboard.

## Manually reporting exceptions and messages

To report a caught exception to Ratchet, simply call `Ratchetio.report_exception`:

```ruby
begin
  foo = bar
rescue Exception => e
  Ratchetio.report_exeption(e)
end
```

If you're reporting an exception in the context of a request and are in a controller, you can pass along the same request and person context as teh global exception handler, like so:

```ruby
begin
  foo = bar
rescue Exception => e
  Ratchetio.report_exception(e, ratchetio_request_data, ratchetio_person_data)
end
```

You can also log individual messages:

```ruby
# logs at the 'warning' level. all levels: debug, info ,warning, error, critical
Ratchetio.report_message("Unexpected input", "warning")

# default level is "info"
Ratchetio.report_message("Login successful")

# can also include additional data as a hash in the final param
Ratchetio.report_message("Login successful", "info", :user => @user)
```

## Person tracking

Ratchet will send information about the current user (called a "person" in Ratchet parlance) along with each error report, when available. This works by trying the `current_user` and `current_member` controller methods. The return value should be an object with an `id` property and, optionally, `username` and `email` properties.

```ruby
alias_method :my_user_method, :current_user
helper_method :my_user_method
```

## Usage

This gem installs an exception handler into Rails. You don't need to do anything else for it to work.
