# Ratchetio

Ruby gem for Ratchet.io, for reporting exceptions in Rails 3 to Ratchet.io. Requires a Ratchet.io account (you can sign up for free).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ratchetio'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ratchetio

Then, creat a file config/nitializers/ratchetio.rb containing the following:

```ruby
require 'ratchetio/rails'
Ratchetio.configure do |config|
    conifg.access_token = 'YOUR_RATCHETIO_PROJECT_ACCESS_TOKEN'
end
```
Or, run the following command from your rails  root:

```ruby
$ rails generate ratchetio YOUR_RATCETIO_PROJECT_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

That will create the file `config/initializers/ratchetio.rb`, which holds the configuration values (currently just your access token) and is all you need to use Ratchet.io with Rails.

To confirm that it worked, run:

```ruby
$ rake ratchetio:test
```

This will raise an exception within a test request; if it works, you'll see a stacktrace in the console, and the exception will appear in the Ratchet.io dashboard.

## Usage

This gem installs an exception handler into Rails. You don't need to do anything else for it to work.
